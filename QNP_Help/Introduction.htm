<h5>Quick Nav Planner (QNP) will run on any PC/Laptop running Windows
XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 .The minimum screen resolution is 1280 X 800. 
</h5>
<h6>Quick Nav Planner (QNP) provides on-screen and fuel plans together with flight-log
forms which can be quickly produced then printed for immediate use in the aircraft.
It provides sunrise/sunset times for each waypoint. You can carry out any
fuel planning requirements without an internet connection. As local and external
computer networks can sometimes fail, we recommend that you provide at least
one computer which is directly connected to a printer. This will ensure that flight
planning and printing of fuel plans and flight logs can be achieved even when the
network is unavailable. Map View feature of the QNP will not be available without the internet.
<br/><br/>The designed accuracy for the flight planning section of this software is 1° for tracks
and headings, 1 knot for groundspeed, 0.1 nautical miles for distances, 1 minute
for times and 1 second for sunrise/sunset times. The operational coverage area is
worldwide. All distances, tracks and headings are based on Great Circle calculations
compliant with GRS80 Authalic Sphere. In other words, the world is assumed to be a perfect sphere.
